  Generate a single, unique, and family-friendly event for a "${cardType}" card.
  The event should be described in a short, flavorful text.

  The possible actions are: 
  - PAY_MONEY: Player pays a specific amount to the bank. Amount should be between 10 and 200.
  - RECEIVE_MONEY: Player receives a specific amount from the bank. Amount should be between 10 and 200.
  - MOVE_TO: Player moves to a specific space on the board (spaceId from 0 to 39).
  - MOVE_BY: Player moves forward or backward a number of spaces. Amount should be between -5 and 5, not zero.
  - GO_TO_JAIL: Player is sent to jail.
  - GET_OUT_OF_JAIL_FREE: Player receives a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card.
  - PAY_FOR_BUILDINGS: Player pays a fee for each house and hotel they own.
  - RECEIVE_FROM_PLAYERS: Player receives a small amount from every other player. Amount should be between 10 and 50.

  Provide your response as a JSON object that matches the required schema.

    "amount": 10

  Example 2: "You are assessed for street repairs. $40 per house, $115 per hotel." would be:
